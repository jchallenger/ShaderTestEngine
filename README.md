Testing Application For Shaders in OpenGL using GLSL

This was made by Justin Challenger as a test app for creating and modifying shader techniques.
It became a project that included creating menus and useful functions for manuevuring the scene. It became a full model loading, texture loading, scene managing, sound playing, etc project, the first of it's kind made by yours-truly. 

This is my first attempt at making a graphical interactive engine in C++.
